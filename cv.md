#### About me
Hello!
I am 25 years old and the last 5 years I was trying to become a part of many different activities. Half of that time I was a student of the Institute of foreign languages in PetrSU (Petrozavodsk State Univercity). My english developed to a pretty good level there, but I understood that languages and pedagogy is not the way I want to go. As I left the University I tried plenty of different occupations, but most of them were able to hold my interest only for a couple of months. The situation changed with programming. A couple of years passed since I wrote my first "Hello World!". And it's great to understand that the deeeper I go inside programming the more it interests me. I have a list of small "pet-rojects" and I got no "real work experience", but very eager to obtain it and of course "to help a world to become a better place".

**strengths**:

#### Code example:
[**Task from codewars**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/554b4ac871d6813a03000035): In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

**my solution**:
```js
function highAndLow(dat){
    let strNumb = dat.split(' ');
    strNumb.sort((a, b) =>{
        return a-b;
    }).reverse();

    return strNumb[0].concat(` ${strNumb[strNumb.length - 1]}`);
}
```
